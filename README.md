# parking-system

the project has 2 main files car_parking_system.py which has all the functions and logic for the parking system and input.py which takes a txt file as input and runs the program.

As the input should be a text file hence i have created 2 test files named test_file1.txt and test_file2.txt . In order to chech the result for a particluar file
run this command into the project directory
  python input.py test_file1.txt
  
  this will run the program for that particular test_file1.txt
  
  you can also create your own input txt.file and can run the command
  
  python input.py your_file_name.txt
